# What is HTTPS?

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP

- üîí **Encrypted** - Secures the communication between client and server
- üîê **Authenticated** - Verifies the identity of the website
- üõ°Ô∏è **Integrity** - Prevents data tampering during transmission
- üåê **Standard** - The de facto standard for secure web communication
- üìà **SEO** - Improves search engine rankings

# How HTTPS Works

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

1. **SSL/TLS Handshake**
   - Client and server agree on encryption algorithms
   - Server sends its SSL certificate
   - Client verifies the certificate

2. **Key Exchange**
   - A secure symmetric key is established

3. **Encrypted Communication**
   - Data is encrypted using the symmetric key
   - Secure data transfer begins

    Server->>Client: Server Finished
    Client->>Server: Client Finished
    Note over Client,Server: Encrypted Communication

# Implementing HTTPS

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

1. **Obtain an SSL/TLS Certificate**
   - Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
   - Consider using Let's Encrypt for free certificates

2. **Install the Certificate**
   - Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
   - Set up automatic renewal

3. **Update Your Website**
   - Change all URLs to use `https://`
   - Update internal links and resources

4. **Enable HSTS**
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security
   - Forces HTTPS connections

</div>
<div>

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/certificate.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    # ... other configurations ...
}
```
